# Nature-Of-Code-Open-Frameworks-Port
Most of the examples from Daniel Shiffman's Nature Of Code, ported to Open Frameworks. Could do with some tidying up and commenting - I'll probably come back to it at some stage & any improvements anyone else wants to make would be most welcome. 

The original is here: http://natureofcode.com/ 

This is work produced while teaching myself Open Frameworks, C++ and some creative coding concepts by converting Shiffman's examples to OF.
