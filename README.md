# Nature-Of-Code-Open-Frameworks-Port
Most of the examples from Daniel Shiffman's Nature Of Code, ported to Open Frameworks. (Could do with some tidying up and commenting)

The original is here: http://natureofcode.com/ 

This is work produced while teaching myself Open Frameworks, C++ and some creative coding concepts by converting Shiffman's examples to OF.
